   *
   * To access a private or password-protected cloud recording of a user in your account, use a [Zoom JWT app](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/getting-started/app-types/create-jwt-app). Use the generated JWT token as the value of the `access_token` query parameter and include this query parameter at the end of the URL. For example:
   *
   * `https://{{base-domain}}/rec/download/{{path-to-file-download}}?access_token={{JWT-token}}`
   *
   * **OAuth apps**
   *
   * If a user has authorized and installed your OAuth app that contains recording scopes, use the user's [OAuth access token](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/auth/oauth) to download the file. For example:
   *
   * `https://{{base-domain}}/rec/archive/download/xxx?access_token={{OAuth-access-token}}`

   *
   * **Note:** We recommend that you send the access_token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header, for example: "Authorization": "Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>‚Äù.
